Processes of Plant and Animal Organ Systems:
Plants and animals have specialized organ systems that perform essential functions. In plants, photosynthesis occurs in the leaves, where they convert sunlight into energy. Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil. In animals, the circulatory system pumps blood to transport oxygen and nutrients. The respiratory system exchanges gases, while the digestive system processes food and absorbs nutrients. The nervous system coordinates communication, and the musculoskeletal system allows movement and support.
