Recombinant DNA technology involves combining genetic material from different sources to create novel DNA sequences. This technology has revolutionized medicine, agriculture, and industry. In medicine, it enables the production of therapeutic proteins (insulin, growth hormones). In agriculture, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) offer increased crop yields and resistance to pests. Recombinant DNA has also contributed to the development of gene therapy, helping treat genetic disorders.
