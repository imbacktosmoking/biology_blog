            <description><![CDATA[Homeostasis is the process by which organisms maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. Feedback mechanisms, like negative feedback, play a key role. When a condition deviates from its set point (e.g., body temperature rises), receptors detect the change and send signals to effectors (like sweat glands) to counteract the change and restore balance. Positive feedback amplifies changes (e.g., blood clotting) until a goal is achieved.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Recombinant DNA technology involves combining genetic material from different sources to create novel DNA sequences. This technology has revolutionized medicine, agriculture, and industry. In medicine, it enables the production of therapeutic proteins (insulin, growth hormones). In agriculture, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) offer increased crop yields and resistance to pests. Recombinant DNA has also contributed to the development of gene therapy, helping treat genetic disorders.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Recombinant DNA technology is a significant advancement in science that has greatly facilitated human life. It has developed methods for medicinal applications recently, particularly for the creation of vaccines and protein medicines like human insulin, interferon, and growth hormone. It also aids in the creation of gene therapy and the production of clotting factors for the treatment of hemophilia. The advancements it made not only in people but also in plants and microorganisms are quite significant. The obstacles in enhancing goods at the gene level occasionally present severe challenges that must be resolved for the benefit of the future of recombinant DNA technology.]]></description>
