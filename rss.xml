            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The animal organ systems are responsible for numerous functions, namely, reproduction, development, nutrition, gas exchange, transport or circulation, regulation of body fluids, chemical and nervous control, immune systems, and sensory and motor mechanisms.</p><p>The animal organ systems are responsible for numerous functions, namely, reproduction, development, nutrition, gas exchange, transport or circulation, regulation of body fluids, chemical and nervous control, immune systems, and sensory and motor mechanisms.</p><p>Reproduction: Animals are able to produce asexually or sexually.
Sexual: Gametes are combined to create an offspring. Through gametogenesis, mating, and fertilization. In gametogenesis, the gametes are produced. Mating brings the gametes together. Fertilization is when the gametes are fused through internal fertilization or external fertilization.</p><p>Asexual: This type of reproduction commonly happens on protists, hydra, cnidarians, some of the complex animals, and amoeba. The offspring created are identical to the parent which is why it is sometimes called “clonal reproduction”.
Three Mechanisms:
Budding - The outgrow from a parent organism becomes a new individual which may detach or stay intact.
Fission - The body of an organism is divided into two or more parts that are equal.
Fragmentation - An organism’s body breaks into fragments and these fragments become separate individuals.</p><p>Development: Animals develop following processes:</p><ol><li>Gametogenesis - Gametes are produced, which are sperm (male) and egg cells    (female)</li><li>Fertilization - A zygote is created once a single sperm fertilizes the egg during fertilization.</li><li>Pre Embryonic Development - A multicellular embryo is produced when a zygote is divided.</li><li>Embryonic Development - The organ and organ systems develop, and at the end of      this stage, the main organs and all tissues are present.</li><li>Post Embryonic Development - The embryos of the animals develop into any of the following fetuses, nymphs, or larvae.</li></ol><p>Nutrition: Animals require carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and essential nutrients that include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, and vitamins for their nutrition.</p><ol><li>Carbohydrates - The major source of energy in the body’s cells.</li><li>Proteins - Proteins are used as building materials for bones, enzymes, muscles, cell structures, and hormones.</li><li>Fats - Fats are used as insulators for the nerve tissue, an energy source, and in building cellular structures, cell membranes, and steroid hormones.</li><li>Essential nutrients - It is composed of substances that animals cannot synthesize internally, which are obtained from the food they consume.</li></ol><p>Gas Exchange: In simple animals, there is a direct  gas exchange with the environment. However, the gas exchange between the environment and the blood occurs to complex animals like mammals. The blood then carries carbon dioxide from the body for elimination while carrying oxygen to the body's most deeply entrenched cells.</p><p>Transport/Circulation: Animals use the circulatory system for transportation and circulation. The heart, an organ, is used to pump blood. The ventricle is a path going towards the heart, while the atrium is a path away from the heart.</p><p>Regulation of Body Fluids: Animals regulate body fluids through the excretory system. To interfere with osmotic pressure, the protein metabolism creates waste molecules. The organs in charge for osmoregulation vary between species.</p><p>Chemical and Nervous Control: The endocrine system is responsible for regulating chemical control which involves various hormones. It is slow but has a long-term effect on the organism. The nervous system is incharge of nervous control. It is fast and has a short effect, but it is continuous or repetitive stimulation that can be stored to create a behavioral response that lasts longer.</p><p>Immune Systems: Animals’ immune systems are classified into two categories which are innate and adaptive. Innate refers to the defense system such as physical barriers like the skin. Adaptive refers to immunity that creates an army of immune cells to attack the antigen and stores it to its memory.</p><p>Sensory and Motor Mechanisms: The sensory and motor mechanisms of animals are controlled by the nervous system which is composed of neurons. It detects stimuli in the environment through sensory receptors. Animals will only react to environmental stimuli that they choose to accept. There are four types of stimuli which are visual, auditory, tactile, and chemicals. Visual is what an animal sees. Auditory is what an animal hears. Tactile is what an animal feels and chemical is what an animal smells or tastes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Root System:]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Root System:</p><p>Absorption: Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through tiny root hairs. This water and these minerals are essential for the plant's growth and metabolism.
Anchorage: Roots anchor the plant in the soil, providing stability and support.
Shoot System:</p><p>Photosynthesis: Leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis, where they use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen.
Transpiration: Leaves also play a role in transpiration, the process by which water vapor escapes from small openings called stomata, helping to draw water up from the roots.
Support and Transport: Stems provide structural support for the plant and transport water, minerals, and nutrients between the roots and leaves.
Reproductive System:</p><p>Flower Formation: Flowers are reproductive structures that contain male (stamens) and female (carpels) reproductive organs. They attract pollinators to aid in fertilization.
Fertilization: After pollination, fertilization occurs, resulting in the formation of seeds.
Seed Dispersal: Once seeds are mature, various mechanisms such as wind, animals, or water help disperse them, allowing new plants to grow elsewhere.
Vascular System:</p><p>Xylem: Xylem is responsible for transporting water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. It also provides structural support.
Phloem: Phloem transports sugars produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant, where they are used for energy or stored.
Storage System:</p><p>Root Storage: Some plants store excess nutrients and carbohydrates in their roots, tubers, or rhizomes for later use.
Stem Storage: Some plants have modified stems, like cacti, that store water for survival during dry periods.
Leaf Storage: Certain plants, such as succulents, store water and nutrients in their leaves.
Defense System:</p><p>Chemical Defense: Many plants produce chemicals, like alkaloids and tannins, to deter herbivores and pathogens.
Physical Defense: Thorns, spines, and tough leaves can deter herbivores.
Growth and Development:</p><p>Cell Division and Elongation: Plants grow through cell division in meristematic tissues (apical and lateral meristems) and cell elongation, which allows them to increase in size.
Differentiation: Cells differentiate into specialized cell types, leading to the formation of various plant tissues and organs.
Tropisms: Plants respond to environmental cues, such as light (phototropism) and gravity (gravitropism), by bending or growing in specific directions.
Respiration:</p><p>Like animals, plants respire by taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Respiration occurs mainly in the cells of roots, stems, and leaves, producing energy for various metabolic processes.
Sensory and Signaling Systems:</p><p>Plants can sense and respond to various environmental signals, such as light, gravity, and touch, which influence their growth and development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeostasis is a fundamental biological concept that refers to the ability of living organisms to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. This stability is crucial for the proper functioning of cells and the overall health and survival of an organism. Homeostasis is maintained primarily through feedback mechanisms, which involve a continuous cycle of monitoring, responding to changes, and restoring equilibrium. Here's how homeostasis is maintained by these feedback mechanisms in expanding organisms:</p><p>Sensor (Receptor): The first component of a feedback mechanism is a sensor or receptor. These are specialized cells or structures in the organism that detect changes in the internal or external environment. For example, in humans, temperature sensors in the skin and hypothalamus detect changes in body temperature.</p><p>Set Point: Every homeostatic system has a set point, which is the desired or optimal level of a particular parameter, such as temperature, blood pressure, or glucose concentration. The set point serves as a reference point for maintaining stability.</p><p>Control Center: When the sensor detects a deviation from the set point, it sends this information to a control center, often located in the brain or other regulatory organs. The control center processes the information and determines an appropriate response.</p><p>Effector: The control center then sends commands to effectors, which are muscles or glands that carry out the response to counteract the deviation from the set point. Effectors can be muscles that cause shivering to raise body temperature or glands that release hormones to lower blood sugar levels.</p><p>Response: The effectors initiate a response that acts to bring the parameter back to the set point. This response can be either negative feedback or positive feedback:</p><p>Negative Feedback: This is the most common type of feedback mechanism in homeostasis. It involves actions that counteract the initial change, returning the parameter to the set point. For example, when body temperature rises above the set point, negative feedback mechanisms like sweating and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) help cool the body down.</p><p>Positive Feedback: In some situations, positive feedback mechanisms amplify the initial change rather than counteract it. However, this usually occurs temporarily and often leads to a specific outcome. An example of positive feedback is the release of oxytocin during childbirth, which increases uterine contractions, leading to further release of oxytocin until the baby is delivered.</p><p>Monitoring and Adjustment: The feedback loop continues as the sensor continues to monitor the parameter and provide feedback to the control center. Adjustments are made continuously until the parameter returns to the set point. Once stability is achieved, the feedback loop can reduce the response to maintain the parameter within a narrow range.</p><p>In summary, feedback mechanisms are essential for maintaining homeostasis in expanding organisms. They enable organisms to detect and respond to changes in their internal and external environments, ensuring that critical physiological parameters remain within a narrow range conducive to proper functioning and survival.</p>]]></content:encoded>
