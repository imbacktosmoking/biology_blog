Sexual: Gametes are combined to create an offspring. Through gametogenesis, mating, and fertilization. In gametogenesis, the gametes are produced. Mating brings the gametes together. Fertilization is when the gametes are fused through internal fertilization or external fertilization.</p><p>Asexual: This type of reproduction commonly happens on protists, hydra, cnidarians, some of the complex animals, and amoeba. The offspring created are identical to the parent which is why it is sometimes called “clonal reproduction”.
Three Mechanisms:
Budding - The outgrow from a parent organism becomes a new individual which may detach or stay intact.
Fission - The body of an organism is divided into two or more parts that are equal.
Fragmentation - An organism’s body breaks into fragments and these fragments become separate individuals.</p><p>Development: Animals develop following processes:</p><ol><li>Gametogenesis - Gametes are produced, which are sperm (male) and egg cells    (female)</li><li>Fertilization - A zygote is created once a single sperm fertilizes the egg during fertilization.</li><li>Pre Embryonic Development - A multicellular embryo is produced when a zygote is divided.</li><li>Embryonic Development - The organ and organ systems develop, and at the end of      this stage, the main organs and all tissues are present.</li><li>Post Embryonic Development - The embryos of the animals develop into any of the following fetuses, nymphs, or larvae.</li></ol><p>Nutrition: Animals require carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and essential nutrients that include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, and vitamins for their nutrition.</p><ol><li>Carbohydrates - The major source of energy in the body’s cells.</li><li>Proteins - Proteins are used as building materials for bones, enzymes, muscles, cell structures, and hormones.</li><li>Fats - Fats are used as insulators for the nerve tissue, an energy source, and in building cellular structures, cell membranes, and steroid hormones.</li><li>Essential nutrients - It is composed of substances that animals cannot synthesize internally, which are obtained from the food they consume.</li></ol><p>Gas Exchange: In simple animals, there is a direct  gas exchange with the environment. However, the gas exchange between the environment and the blood occurs to complex animals like mammals. The blood then carries carbon dioxide from the body for elimination while carrying oxygen to the body's most deeply entrenched cells.</p><p>Transport/Circulation: Animals use the circulatory system for transportation and circulation. The heart, an organ, is used to pump blood. The ventricle is a path going towards the heart, while the atrium is a path away from the heart.</p><p>Regulation of Body Fluids: Animals regulate body fluids through the excretory system. To interfere with osmotic pressure, the protein metabolism creates waste molecules. The organs in charge for osmoregulation vary between species.</p><p>Chemical and Nervous Control: The endocrine system is responsible for regulating chemical control which involves various hormones. It is slow but has a long-term effect on the organism. The nervous system is incharge of nervous control. It is fast and has a short effect, but it is continuous or repetitive stimulation that can be stored to create a behavioral response that lasts longer.</p><p>Immune Systems: Animals’ immune systems are classified into two categories which are innate and adaptive. Innate refers to the defense system such as physical barriers like the skin. Adaptive refers to immunity that creates an army of immune cells to attack the antigen and stores it to its memory.</p><p>Sensory and Motor Mechanisms: The sensory and motor mechanisms of animals are controlled by the nervous system which is composed of neurons. It detects stimuli in the environment through sensory receptors. Animals will only react to environmental stimuli that they choose to accept. There are four types of stimuli which are visual, auditory, tactile, and chemicals. Visual is what an animal sees. Auditory is what an animal hears. Tactile is what an animal feels and chemical is what an animal smells or tastes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Root System:]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Root System:</p><p>Absorption: Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through tiny root hairs. This water and these minerals are essential for the plant's growth and metabolism.
Anchorage: Roots anchor the plant in the soil, providing stability and support.
Shoot System:</p><p>Photosynthesis: Leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis, where they use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen.
Transpiration: Leaves also play a role in transpiration, the process by which water vapor escapes from small openings called stomata, helping to draw water up from the roots.
Support and Transport: Stems provide structural support for the plant and transport water, minerals, and nutrients between the roots and leaves.
Reproductive System:</p><p>Flower Formation: Flowers are reproductive structures that contain male (stamens) and female (carpels) reproductive organs. They attract pollinators to aid in fertilization.
Fertilization: After pollination, fertilization occurs, resulting in the formation of seeds.
Seed Dispersal: Once seeds are mature, various mechanisms such as wind, animals, or water help disperse them, allowing new plants to grow elsewhere.
Vascular System:</p><p>Xylem: Xylem is responsible for transporting water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. It also provides structural support.
Phloem: Phloem transports sugars produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant, where they are used for energy or stored.
Storage System:</p><p>Root Storage: Some plants store excess nutrients and carbohydrates in their roots, tubers, or rhizomes for later use.
Stem Storage: Some plants have modified stems, like cacti, that store water for survival during dry periods.
Leaf Storage: Certain plants, such as succulents, store water and nutrients in their leaves.
Defense System:</p><p>Chemical Defense: Many plants produce chemicals, like alkaloids and tannins, to deter herbivores and pathogens.
Physical Defense: Thorns, spines, and tough leaves can deter herbivores.
Growth and Development:</p><p>Cell Division and Elongation: Plants grow through cell division in meristematic tissues (apical and lateral meristems) and cell elongation, which allows them to increase in size.
Differentiation: Cells differentiate into specialized cell types, leading to the formation of various plant tissues and organs.
Tropisms: Plants respond to environmental cues, such as light (phototropism) and gravity (gravitropism), by bending or growing in specific directions.
Respiration:</p><p>Like animals, plants respire by taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Respiration occurs mainly in the cells of roots, stems, and leaves, producing energy for various metabolic processes.
Sensory and Signaling Systems:</p><p>Plants can sense and respond to various environmental signals, such as light, gravity, and touch, which influence their growth and development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeostasis, the critical maintenance of a stable internal environment in expanding organisms, relies on feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms ensure that conditions like</p><p> temperature, blood glucose levels, osmolarity, blood pressure, and hormonal regulation of growth and reproduction remain within a narrow range. Negative feedback is a fundamental mechanism in homeostasis. For instance, when an organism's temperature deviates from the norm, sensors detect the change and signal corrective responses, such as sweating or shivering, to bring the temperature back to the set point. Similarly, blood glucose levels are regulated through negative feedback, with insulin and glucagon adjusting levels as needed. Osmoregulation maintains water and solute balance via the release of antidiuretic hormone when blood becomes too concentrated.</p><p>Blood pressure regulation involves baroreceptors detecting deviations from the norm and triggering vasodilation or vasoconstriction, along with heart rate adjustments to maintain optimal blood pressure. Hormonal regulation of growth and reproductive hormones operates through both positive and negative feedback mechanisms. During growth, hormones like growth hormone stimulate expansion in an organism, while negative feedback mechanisms ensure growth doesn't continue unchecked once a certain size is reached. In reproductive hormone regulation, positive feedback contributes to ovulation through the release of luteinizing hormone after rising estrogen levels, while negative feedback subsequently inhibits LH production to maintain stability. These feedback mechanisms collaborate to sustain a balanced internal environment crucial for an organism's well-being and adaptation.</p>]]></content:encoded>
