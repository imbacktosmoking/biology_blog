In plants, photosynthesis occurs in the leaves, where they convert sunlight into energy. Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil. In animals, the circulatory system pumps blood to transport oxygen and nutrients. The respiratory system exchanges gases, while the digestive system processes food and absorbs nutrients. The nervous system coordinates communication, and the musculoskeletal system allows movement and support."},{"id":"homeostasis-and-organisms-feedback-mechanisms","metadata":{"permalink":"/biology_blog/blog/homeostasis-and-organisms-feedback-mechanisms","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-21-second copy.md","title":"Homeostasis and Organisms\' Feedback Mechanisms","description":"Homeostasis is the process by which organisms maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. Feedback mechanisms, like negative feedback, play a key role. When a condition deviates from its set point (e.g., body temperature rises), receptors detect the change and send signals to effectors (like sweat glands) to counteract the change and restore balance. Positive feedback amplifies changes (e.g., blood clotting) until a goal is achieved.","date":"2023-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"biology","permalink":"/biology_blog/blog/tags/biology"}],"readingTime":0.34,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Romualdo M.
