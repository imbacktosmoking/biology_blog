Through gametogenesis, mating, and fertilization. In gametogenesis, the gametes are produced. Mating brings the gametes together. Fertilization is when the gametes are fused through internal fertilization or external fertilization.\\n\\nAsexual: This type of reproduction commonly happens on protists, hydra, cnidarians, some of the complex animals, and amoeba. The offspring created are identical to the parent which is why it is sometimes called \u201cclonal reproduction\u201d.\\nThree Mechanisms:\\nBudding - The outgrow from a parent organism becomes a new individual which may detach or stay intact.\\nFission - The body of an organism is divided into two or more parts that are equal.\\nFragmentation - An organism\u2019s body breaks into fragments and these fragments become separate individuals.\\n\\nDevelopment: Animals develop following processes:\\n1. Gametogenesis - Gametes are produced, which are sperm (male) and egg cells    (female)\\n2. Fertilization - A zygote is created once a single sperm fertilizes the egg during fertilization.\\n3. Pre Embryonic Development - A multicellular embryo is produced when a zygote is divided.\\n4. Embryonic Development - The organ and organ systems develop, and at the end of      this stage, the main organs and all tissues are present.\\n5. Post Embryonic Development - The embryos of the animals develop into any of the following fetuses, nymphs, or larvae.\\n\\nNutrition: Animals require carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and essential nutrients that include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, and vitamins for their nutrition.\\n1. Carbohydrates - The major source of energy in the body\u2019s cells.\\n2. Proteins - Proteins are used as building materials for bones, enzymes, muscles, cell structures, and hormones.\\n3. Fats - Fats are used as insulators for the nerve tissue, an energy source, and in building cellular structures, cell membranes, and steroid hormones.\\n4. Essential nutrients - It is composed of substances that animals cannot synthesize internally, which are obtained from the food they consume.\\n\\nGas Exchange: In simple animals, there is a direct  gas exchange with the environment. However, the gas exchange between the environment and the blood occurs to complex animals like mammals. The blood then carries carbon dioxide from the body for elimination while carrying oxygen to the body\'s most deeply entrenched cells.\\n\\nTransport/Circulation: Animals use the circulatory system for transportation and circulation. The heart, an organ, is used to pump blood. The ventricle is a path going towards the heart, while the atrium is a path away from the heart.\\n\\nRegulation of Body Fluids: Animals regulate body fluids through the excretory system. To interfere with osmotic pressure, the protein metabolism creates waste molecules. The organs in charge for osmoregulation vary between species.\\n\\nChemical and Nervous Control: The endocrine system is responsible for regulating chemical control which involves various hormones. It is slow but has a long-term effect on the organism. The nervous system is incharge of nervous control. It is fast and has a short effect, but it is continuous or repetitive stimulation that can be stored to create a behavioral response that lasts longer.\\n\\nImmune Systems: Animals\u2019 immune systems are classified into two categories which are innate and adaptive. Innate refers to the defense system such as physical barriers like the skin. Adaptive refers to immunity that creates an army of immune cells to attack the antigen and stores it to its memory.\\n\\nSensory and Motor Mechanisms: The sensory and motor mechanisms of animals are controlled by the nervous system which is composed of neurons. It detects stimuli in the environment through sensory receptors. Animals will only react to environmental stimuli that they choose to accept. There are four types of stimuli which are visual, auditory, tactile, and chemicals. Visual is what an animal sees. Auditory is what an animal hears. Tactile is what an animal feels and chemical is what an animal smells or tastes."},{"id":"Process-of-the-Functions-of-Plant-Organ-Systems","metadata":{"permalink":"/biology_blog/Process-of-the-Functions-of-Plant-Organ-Systems","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-23-second copy.md","title":"Process of the Functions of Plant Organ Systems","description":"Root System:","date":"2023-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 23, 2023","tags":[{"label":"biology","permalink":"/biology_blog/tags/biology"}],"readingTime":2.095,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ephraim Ong","title":"Writer","imageURL":"img/ephraim.jpg","key":"ephraim"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Process-of-the-Functions-of-Plant-Organ-Systems","title":"Process of the Functions of Plant Organ Systems","authors":"ephraim","tags":["biology"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Processes of the functions animal organ systems","permalink":"/biology_blog/Processes-of-plants-and-animal-organ-systems"},"nextItem":{"title":"Current-Uses-of-Recombinant-DNA","permalink":"/biology_blog/Current-Uses-of-Recombinant-DNA"}},"content":"Root System:\\n\\nAbsorption: Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through tiny root hairs.

These mechanisms ensure that conditions like\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n temperature, blood glucose levels, osmolarity, blood pressure, and hormonal regulation of growth and reproduction remain within a narrow range. Negative feedback is a fundamental mechanism in homeostasis. For instance, when an organism\'s temperature deviates from the norm, sensors detect the change and signal corrective responses, such as sweating or shivering, to bring the temperature back to the set point. Similarly, blood glucose levels are regulated through negative feedback, with insulin and glucagon adjusting levels as needed. Osmoregulation maintains water and solute balance via the release of antidiuretic hormone when blood becomes too concentrated.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlood pressure regulation involves baroreceptors detecting deviations from the norm and triggering vasodilation or vasoconstriction, along with heart rate adjustments to maintain optimal blood pressure. Hormonal regulation of growth and reproductive hormones operates through both positive and negative feedback mechanisms. During growth, hormones like growth hormone stimulate expansion in an organism, while negative feedback mechanisms ensure growth doesn\'t continue unchecked once a certain size is reached. In reproductive hormone regulation, positive feedback contributes to ovulation through the release of luteinizing hormone after rising estrogen levels, while negative feedback subsequently inhibits LH production to maintain stability. These feedback mechanisms collaborate to sustain a balanced internal environment crucial for an organism\'s well-being and adaptation."},{"id":"Recombinant-DNA\u2019s-Significance-to-Society","metadata":{"permalink":"/biology_blog/Recombinant-DNA\u2019s-Significance-to-Society","source":"@site/blog/2023-8-21-fifth.md","title":"Recombinant DNA\u2019s Significance to Society","description":"Recombinant DNA technology is a significant advancement in science that has greatly facilitated human life.
