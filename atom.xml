        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Homeostasis is the process by which organisms maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. Feedback mechanisms, like negative feedback, play a key role. When a condition deviates from its set point (e.g., body temperature rises), receptors detect the change and send signals to effectors (like sweat glands) to counteract the change and restore balance. Positive feedback amplifies changes (e.g., blood clotting) until a goal is achieved.]]></summary>
